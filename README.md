## Background

Young, self-motivated and diligent aspiring Full-Stack Developer who has just graduated from renowned software development bootcamp [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech).

<!-- Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech. -->
After finishing my A levels, I was offered university places but chose employment with an apprenticeship as my path to further education as I believed this would give me a better insight into the application of academic knowledge to the real world. During the last three and a half years I have worked in three separate jobs within the Accounting and Finance sector. My employers encouraged me to study accountancy by day release. This education combined with what I learnt performing my work, individually and as a team member, helped my personal development.

However, after careful consideration of other potential options I concluded a career as an accountant would not provide the type of challenges which would enable me to continue to be productive and fulfilled.

In contrast, I wholeheartedly believe a career in technology will provide creativity, excitement and diversity. I relish the opportunity to both solve and assist in the solution of logic-based challenges. I believe this dynamic environment will provide ample opportunities for personal and professional development. The technology landscape is continuously evolving which necessitates a high demand for people with the same capacity for growth. I strive to be one of those people, constantly learning and developing my skills and knowledge.

## Projects

Over my time at Makers I worked on a variety of different projects both independently or in a team.

## Skills

**Communication**

I'm a proficient communicator and I attribute this mostly with my ability to write and speak coherently. A vital aspect of my prior jobs was being able to liaise with clients and customers regularly. For example in my job at English Rural I often had to speak to suppliers over the phone and obtain the necessary information to ensure all invoice payments were handled correctly. Additionally I had to make sure any time a customer rang all queries, concerns and complaints were documented correctly and forwarded to the relevant department.

**Attention To Detail**

From my years spent working in accounting and finance, pinpointing the small details was a crucial part of my job and I aim to bring this forward into software development. I'm meticulous and often check my work multiple times to ensure 100% accuracy. A good example of this is when I was working at the ACU, I had a tuition fee batch payment of around £5million being paid in support of hundreds of students across numerous different universities. When processing these payments I had to ensure every single detail was correct otherwise this could have been very problematic for both the organisation and the scholar(s).

**Excellent Problem Solving Skills & Adaptability**

With a logical mindset developed from studying A Level Maths & Physics and supplementary analytical experience as a result of my years spent analysing data, I can find methodical solutions to problems quickly. One of my biggest personal coding qualities is being able to identify potential solutions to problems others may have missed and knowing what to search for to find an answer. As someone who has grown up using technology and worked in industries which ran the gamut of an acclaimed non-profit organisation to small commercial businesses, I have the prowess to adapt and learn quickly. For instance before Makers, I'd never used a Mac computer before, within a week I was already proficient using one.

**Teamwork**

Throughout my time at Makers Academy, I was pair programming nearly every day of the course. I thoroughly enjoyed this as working alongside someone else in order to accomplish a shared goal meant that we were both not only consistently learning together, but also presented us the opportunity to bounce off each other's ideas and encouraged us to be inquisitive. As well as pair programming, occasionally we would be collaborating in groups to produce small team projects, these were great experiences as it helped me appreciate how real world projects might be built and furthermore illustrated the significance of having effective team practices, team rituals and creative thinking.

## Interests

Video Games - One of my favourite past times and one of the most influential reasons I find technology as a whole so enthralling.

Music - I've been into most kinds of music from a fairly early age and been to countless gigs and festivals.

Fitness - I firmly believe keeping physically active is not only one of the best things for your body but also for your mind.

Some additional interests and hobbies I've had over the years include travelling, film, writing, technology (Building Gaming PC's, General IT knowledge). Whilst growing up I nurtured my creative side with regular animation practice using programs like Macromedia Flash 8.
