## Peter Alexander Stevens | CV

Young, self-motivated and diligent aspiring Full-Stack Developer who has just graduated from renowned software development bootcamp Makers Academy. 

After finishing my A levels in school and deciding the university path wasn't for me, I went straight into work via an apprenticeship route instead; so I could focus on getting some real world experience and gain a vocational qualification. I spent the last three and a half years working full time in Accounting and Finance. During this period I worked three separate jobs which provided a wealth of different experiences, these industries ran the gamut of an acclaimed non-profit organisation to small commercial businesses. 

The concern I had was the uncertainity whether this profession would provide sufficient mental stimulation to maintain my interest in the long haul.
