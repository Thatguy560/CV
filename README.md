## Background

Young, self-motivated and diligent aspiring Full-Stack Developer who has just graduated from renowned software development bootcamp [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). 

<!-- Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech. -->
After finishing my A levels in school and deciding the university path wasn't for me, I went straight into work via an apprenticeship route instead. I spent the last three and a half years working (and simultaneously studying) full time in Accounting and Finance. During this period I worked three separate jobs which provided a wealth of different experiences, these industries ran the gamut of an acclaimed non-profit organisation to small commercial businesses. 

My concern was if a career in finance would not provide sufficient mental stimulation to maintain my interest.

I wholeheartedly believe a career in tech would provide the creativity, excitement and diversity elements my prior career path was lacking, alongside fresh intellectual logic-based challenges and ample opportunities for personal and professional development. The technology landscape is continuously evolving which necessitates a high demand for people with the same capacity for growth. I strive to be one of those people, constantly learning and developing my skills and knowledge.

## Projects 

Over my time at Makers I worked on a variety of different projects both independently or in a team. I learnt the importance of time keeping and pair programming with regard to team projects.

| Project       | Description                        | Tech Stack    |
| ------------- | -----------------------------------| ------------- |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Thatguy560/Banktechtest)  | A Tech Test built over a 3 day period, using irb you can make deposits, withdrawals, check the balance of your account and print a statement. I used the gem 'Simplecov' for test coverage.                | Ruby, RSpec |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Thatguy560/acebook-5Makerteers)  | A Facebook clone built in a team of five, over a two week period, User stories were provided to us by Makers Coaches.                     | Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Bootstrap, Capybara, RSpec |
| [Road To Discovery](https://github.com/Team-react/Playlist_App)  | About to leave for that 5 hour journey home, but forgot to make a playlist? No problem Introducing: ROAD TO DISCOVERY. This was my final project at Makers Academy and took just under two weeks to build.                     | React, Node, Javascript, Spotify Web API |

## Skills

**Communication** 

I'm a proficient communicator and I attribute this mostly with my ability to write and speak coherently. A vital aspect of my prior jobs was being able to liaise with clients and customers regularly. For example in my job at English Rural I often had to speak to suppliers over the phone and obtain the necessary information to ensure all invoice payments were handled correctly. Additionally I had to make sure any time a customer rang all queries, concerns and complaints were documented correctly and forwarded to the relevant department.

**Attention To Detail**

From my years spent working in accounting and finance, pinpointing the small details was a crucial part of my job and I aim to bring this forward into software development. I'm meticulous and often check my work multiple times to ensure 100% accuracy. A good example of this is when I was working at the ACU, I had a tuition fee batch payment of around £5million being paid in support of hundreds of students across numerous different universities. When processing these payments I had to ensure every single detail was correct otherwise this could have been very problematic for both the organisation and the scholar(s).

**Excellent Numerical & Problem Solving Skills**

With a logical mindset developed from studying A Level Maths & Physics and supplementary analytical experience as a result of my years spent investigating data, I can find methodical solutions to problems quickly. One of my biggest personal qualities with coding is being able to identify potential solutions to problems others may have missed and knowing what to search for to find a answer. 

**Fast Learning New Technologies**

As a result of working working multiple jobs and grown up using technology, I have the ability to quickly learn new software and hardware fast, A good example of this was before Makers, I'd never used a Mac computer before, within a week I was already proficient using one.

## Interests

Video Games - One of my favourite past times and one of the most influential reasons I find technology as a whole so enthralling.

Music - I've been into most kinds of music from a fairly early age and been to countless gigs and festivals.

Fitness - I firmly believe keeping physically active is not only one of the best things for your body but also for your mind.

Some additional interests and hobbies I've had over the years include travelling, film, writing, technology (Building Gaming PC's, General IT knowledge). Whilst growing up I nurtured my creative side with regular animation practice using programs like Macromedia Flash 8.
